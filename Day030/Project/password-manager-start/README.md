# Improving Password manager

* Using json files instead of txt files

NOTE:dictionaries have unique keys so we CANNOT have one website entry(key) having more than 1 email and password.We would need to slightly modify the program using lists or sets.

* Handling Exceptions in Password Manager

* Adding option to search for website name and then displaying email and password in dialog box.
