# Send Email(smtplib) and Manage Dates(datetime)

# Introduction

## Sending emails with Python using SMTP

How does it work?

Eg.Sender:angela@gmail.com

Receiver:timmy@yahoo.com

So email from sender goes to Gmail mail server,Yahoo mail server and then gets stored in Timmy's computer till Timmy logs on to yahoo.com that downloads email from Yahoo server.

This happens due to SMTP(simple mail transfer protocol).In python [smptlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) module lets us use SMTP to send email to any address on the internet.

Set up a fresh gmail account and a fresh yahoo account to test.

NOTE:I have used environment variables to protect my email id and password.
