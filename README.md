# 100daysofcode

Welcome to my 100daysofcode challenge based on Angela Yu's 100 days of code in Python course.

In each day's challenge,inside every exercise done,you can find theory and concepts described in the first part and program implemented below that.

Project covers all concepts done that day

Also included are different ways of implementation and mistakes I made while coding.

Please feel free to point out any mistakes and suggestions.
