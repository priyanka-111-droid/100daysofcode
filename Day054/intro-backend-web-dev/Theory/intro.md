# Components of web development:

Full stack web development =Front-End + Back-End

Front-End languages:HTML,CSS,JS

Front-End frameworks:React,Angular

Back-End languages:JS,Python,Java,Ruby

Back-End frameworks:Node,Flask(python based),Django(python based)

Frameworks are tools that come with code prebuilt for a lot of common functionalities.The code never calls the framework,instead the framework calls you.

### 1.Client:

* User going onto the browser

* This is client-side,this faces the user.

* Basically the page that the user sees when the user visits a website is the Front-End.

* Client-side or Front-End is separated from server and database.

* Real life analogy:In a restaurant,the client side is where the tables are and where customers sit.

### 2.Server:

* Server is a powerful computer connected to internet and is on 24/7,always ready to receive requests over the internet.

* Real life analogy:In a restaurant,this server would be the kitchen.When you order something in the restaurant,kitchen(server) fetches ingredients from larder(database),converts ingredients into a dish(server converts all this data into HTML,CSS,Javascript files) and then delivers to customer(webpage is displayed on the client side for user to view).

### 3.Database

* Sort of like a spreadsheet where you store all information related to website.

* If website has lot of user data or different types of data that could be requested by a user,usually there will be a database.

* Real life analogy:In a restaurant,this would be the larder,where you store ingredients.
