# Adding Python Packages and using Pypi 

We will use codes written by other developers using packages.By integrating packages,we can practice creating objects and working with attributes and methods.

So we go to https://pypi.org/ in order to get new packages.Some useful packages we can install are:

## 1.To  easily print tabular data in a visually appealing ASCII table format,

click [here](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/),copy the pip install command into command prompt to install package.

now use import prettytable to use this in your code.

Read the [project documentation](https://code.google.com/archive/p/prettytable/wikis/Tutorial.wiki) to find out how to use it.
