# Functions

Python has a set of built in functions we have used before like len(),print()

For finding out what other built in functions are there, go to https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

How to create our own function?

We use def keyword to define our function and the main thing that differentiates function from variable is parenthesis().

    def my_function():

        print("Hello") 
        print("Bye")

    #calling the function
    my_function()

Remember all code inside the function is indented

When we need to use this function(),we have to trigger the function or call the function as seen above

# Practice
Go to [Reeborg's world](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Alone&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Falone.json) and here you can try to move a robot using functions.

* ## Task 1:
  Move the robot three steps forward using move()

  For the robot to move three steps forward,type move() three times in the editor and click on the run button(second button from left above the grid).

  After running the program make sure to click **reset button each time(sixth button from left above the grid) to reset the robot**.
  
  If you want to see position of robot after executing each line of code,click **step button(third button from left above the grid)**
  
  For more additional functions,click on Reeborg's keyboard.Note there is no turn_right() or turn_around().

* ## Task 2:
  Moving the robot from box 1 to 3 and then turning around and coming back(use move and turn_left())

  Solution:

* ## Task 3:
  Try to do task 2 by defining a new turn_around() function.Use turn_around() and move()

  Solution:

* ## Task 4:
  Try to define a turn_right() function using only turn_left()

  Solution:
    
        def turn_right():
            turn_left()
            turn_left()
            turn_left()


* ## Task 5:
  Use this turn_right() function and turn_left() function to draw a square in clockwise direction with a side of 2 units.

  Solution:
