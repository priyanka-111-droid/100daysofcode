# To do List website

## Approach

- Started with Frontend - Used HTML Drag and drop API so can drag item from Todo List to Doing List or to Done List etc.(inspired by Trello).Implemented in static/script.js.
- Backend part is similar to Day 88>Cafe and Wifi website.
- Edit todo item is better implemented in this project compared to Day88.


## Future Improvement

- Login and Register
- Add Deadlines for tasks
