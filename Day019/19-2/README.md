## Object state and instances

From Turtle class,lets say I have 2 objects timmy and tommy

    timmy=Turtle()
    tommy=Turtle()

timmy and tommy function separelty from each other though they are created from same class.So they are separate **instances** of each other.

    timmy.color="green"
    tommy.color="purple"

**State** of timmy's colour attribute can be green and tommy's colour attribute is purple.State is different in terms of attribute(appearance) in this case.State can also be diffferent in terms of methods.

## Turtle Race

Create 7 turtles having colours of a rainbow and accept bet from user to enter which colour they think would win.After race,print if user wins or loses.
