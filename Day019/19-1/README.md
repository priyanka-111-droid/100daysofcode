## Event listeners

These help it listen to what user does(like press a key).Once it starts listening,we need to find function that will trigger when user presses a key.Hence we use event listeners.

In turtle documentation,refer to section on using screen events.

eg.[listen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.listen)

Tip:when you are using methods you have not created like onkey(),
use keyword arguments instead of positional arguments

See [practice1.py](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day019/19-1/practice1.py) for demo

## Higher Order functions

Can we take function as input to another function?

## Project:Etch a Sketch

Sketch where pressing W key means moving turtle forwards,S for backward,A for counter clockwise and D for clockwise,C key to clear drawing and put turtle in centre.
