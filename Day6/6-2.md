## Indentation

Whenever we define a function,lines inside function are indented(shifted to right by 4 spaces)

Use 4 spaces per indentation level

PEP 8 style guide of python recommends spaces over tabs for indentation. In python3 ,you cannot mix spaces and tabs in one code file.

    def my_function1():
        print("Hello")  #4 spaces from def

    #the line below is not part of above function
    print("World")

    def my_function2():
        if sky=="clear": #4 spaces from def
            print("blue") #8 spaces from def
        elif sky == "cloudy":
            print("grey")
        
        print("Hello")    #outside if-elif block
    
    print("World")      #outside function block

## While loop

    while something_is_true
        #do something repeatedly

* While Loops are more useful when you don't care which number in a sequence you are in or which item you are iterating(going over)through in a list.

* You just wish to keep do something over and over again until condition becomes false

* While loops more dangerous as in for loops ,loop will stop if it reaches end of list or if it reaches upper bound of range().While loops continue running till condition is false

* You can run into an infinite loop if your condition never becomes false
    
        while 5>3:
            print("Hello")

        #5 is always going to be more than 3
        #This will give an infinite loop!!!!!
        #will keep printing Hello infinite times
