# Rendering HTMLStatic Files and using website templates

# Theory

## Rendering HTML Files with Flask

Since Flask is a framework and not a library,it will place restrictions on our code that we must follow.

In this case,Flask will look for templates(our HTML files) in the templates folder.See [rendering templates](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates).

## Serving static files(like images) using Flask

You need to place images in a folder called static.

See [demo-HTML-site] where we have used only the HTML files from day 42.

# Exercise

1.Working with External CSS stylesheets

Create a CSS stylesheet in the static folder and change the background of the [index.html] page to purple.

See [56-1]

2.Personal Site with CSS

We have used the personal site(implemented with HTML and CSS) from Day 44.We will serve it using Python Flask.

See [56-2]
