# Rendering HTMLStatic Files and using website templates

# Theory

## Rendering HTML Files with Flask

Since Flask is a framework and not a library,it will place restrictions on our code that we must follow.

In this case,Flask will look for templates(our HTML files) in the templates folder.See [rendering templates](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#rendering-templates).

## Serving static files(like images) using Flask

You need to place images in a folder called static.

See [demo-HTML-site](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/tree/main/Day056/demo-HTML-site) where we have used only the HTML files from day 42.

# Exercise

1.Working with External CSS stylesheets

Create a CSS stylesheet in the static folder and change the background of the [index.html](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day042/intermediate_html/index.html) page to purple.

See [56-1](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/tree/main/Day056/Exercise/56-1)

2.Personal Site with CSS

We have used the personal site(implemented with HTML and CSS) from Day 44.We will serve it using Python Flask.

See [56-2](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/tree/main/Day056/Exercise/56-2)
