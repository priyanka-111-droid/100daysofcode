# API Practice-Creating a GUI Quiz App

We will use [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/) to create quiz app called Quizzler.

Challenges

1.Using Quiz App in Day 17,we will modify data.py file so that questions are no longer hardcoded.So when you run code,you will still get console based quiz but question and answer come from Open trivia database through an API call.Number of questions will be 10 and type of question is True/False.[Note:Test with number of questions as 1 or 2]

2.But now some questions have strange symbols like &quot.These are [HTML entities.](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp).
How to get hold of human readable text?Using [this](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-escape.html) we can unescape the text.
How to do this in python?Using html.unescape in the quiz_brain.py file.

3.In ui.py,we will create class Based Tkinter UI.

4.Showing Next Question in GUI

5.Check the Answer

6.Give feedback to the user

7.Update score and fix some bugs(tell user when they have reached end of quiz,disable buttons at end of quiz and reset canvas background to white)
