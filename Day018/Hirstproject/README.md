# Project:Hirst Spot painting

1.Hirst project-part 1:Extract RGB values from images?

* Install [colorgram package](https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/) and read documentation .

* Colour picker:https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp

* We need to extract colours from spot image and store it as rgb tuples inside a list.

* like lists tuples are collection of items,but they cannot be MODIFIED and are denoted by () whereas lists are
denoted by [].

* Also use colour picker to remove shades of white from the rgb tuples as they won't be visible and save the remaining rgb tuples inside a new list.

2.Hirst project-part 2:Drawing Dots(create 10 rows of dots)

* import the colour_list you created in part 1

* Try to use turtle documentation to draw 10 rows of dots
