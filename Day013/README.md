# Debugging

## Bug

Bug is something that prevents our code from doing what it is supposed to.
So once we create a bug,how to identify and remove these bugs?

## How to debug?
Fork or copy starting code of the repl from [here](https://replit.com/@appbrewery/day-13-start).Uncomment code for each step and try to debug it.

OR 

refer to solution under each step which has problem statement and solution in same file.
## Steps:
### 1.Describe the problem(understand problem well).

Solution: [13-1.py](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day013/13-1.py) 

### 2.Reproduce the bug

Sometimes you might get a bug when you run it sometimes you might not.These type of bugs are tricky.
So important thing is to reproduce the error.When does the error happen?See if you can change code so that it always produces the error.
After this try to debug,you will find it is easier to debug now.

Solution:[13-2.py](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day013/13-2.py)


### 3.Play Computer and evaluate each line

Pretend to be computer,read through the code and think what you would do each time you input a value and how you would evaluate.

Solution:[13-3.py](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day013/13-3.py)

### 4.Fix the Errors

When the editor gives you red underlines while writing code or errors when you run them,fix them before continuing.

Solution:[13-4.py](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day013/13-4.py)

### 5.Print is your friend

Use print statements to find out your bugs.

Solution:[13-5.py](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day013/13-5.py)

### 6.Use a debugger

Get the web version of a debugger [here](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)

Copy the code for this step and paste into above web debugger and click on visualize execution and click next to execute each line of code.

Solution:[13-6.py](https://github.com/priyanka-111-droid/100daysofcode/blob/main/Day013/13-6.py)

### Extra tip:Use [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
